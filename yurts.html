        <h2>Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
        <section><h3><strong>What is yurt?</strong></h3>
            <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four
                feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with
                canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</p></section>
        <section><h3><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></h3>
            <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt
                and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity
                and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities
                are located in the lodge.</p></section>
        <section><h3><strong>What should I bring?</strong></h3>
            <p>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress
                for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful
                to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</p></section>
